I did two creative features, using my knowledge I learned along the way.
The first one was changing the background color using the random number generator
to randomize the background color whenever the user hit c, this was easily done
using the update function to continually update the background of the values were
changed. The second feature I wanted to replicate fireworks going off on the screen
I made it so whenever the user pressed q the emitter would teleport to a randomized
spot on the screen and start spewing particles in all directions using the vector2
function the color was also randomized for the fireworks as well, I also built in
some ways to return to a normal non firework particle and to return to a default
black screen.
